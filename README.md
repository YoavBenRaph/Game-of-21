# Simple-game-of-21


- All cards are used
- Ace can be 1 or 11  (user picks and can change their minds)
- Suite does not matter
- There is a total running for what you have in your hand
- There is a win/lose counter going
- The game will play until the users wants to quit OR they lose 10 hands
- If both the house and you have the same total it is a draw game
- There can only be 4 of each card
- We are not worried about suit
